The user should be able to filter files and folders by:
    - Name (with wildcards or patterns)
    - File size
    - File type (txt, png, etc)
    - Date modified
    - The filter should work efficiently (with low latency).
    - Support composite filtering (like “name starts with foo AND size > 1MB”)



Composite Pattern (File/Folder)
Specification/Filter Pattern (for filtering criteria)
(Optionally) Template Method (for the filtering algorithm structure)
